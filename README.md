the Chamber site is all just front end the submit buttons dont work.

Sail was one of my firsts... i'm sure you can tell.

Temple Inn and Suites was a final and there is a setting in there that will show weather warnings if the weather is bad. (I thought that was cool)

Pokemon is a personality test that is just in the terminal and it does repeat questions but it was fun to make! Sometime I will fix it and have it flawless.
