          This website will help young adults and people who have been sailing for a while but haven’t 
          found the right spot or supplies for sailing. We want people who know nothing about sailing to be 
          able to learn enough to get started, and we want to be able to teach an old dog a new trick with 
          some information about sailing, whether it’s a new place to sail, or new tips and tricks! This is 
          for people from Rexburg all the way to Twin Falls and everywhere in between!
        </p>
