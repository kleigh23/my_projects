      <h3>About Sailing</h3>
      <p>
        Sailing has been a part of the human experience for century’s, in fact some of the earliest art ever discovered pictured 
        sailboats. Every major civilization sailed and even had their own unique sail boats. Some of these are familiar to you, 
        the Viking longboat, the Polynesian Voyaging Canoe, and of course the Spanish Galleon. The traditions of 
        sailing are still strong in the coastal regions of most countries, but with the advance of transportation 
        sailing is spreading inland. Now sailing is a common sight on some of Idaho’s lakes and reservoirs. 
        You may have noticed driving past American Falls reservoir some large colorful sails skimming the water, 
        just a few years ago that would have seemed out of place, but today it is a more common occurrence.

      <h3>Why Try Sailing</h3>
      <p>
        Sailing is a common tie most cultures have one to another, it is a shared experience that two cultures can share. 
        Not to mention that it is incredibly fun. Depending on what you are 
        interested in there is a type of sailing for that! Want a fast-paced adventure? Try racing sailing. Just want to 
        explore? Just do some exploration sailing. Looking for a relaxing time with friends? You can just let the wind 
        guide your sail and have the time of your life. There are numerous types of sailboats, but the most common 
        ones to see in southeast Idaho would be the catamaran and the sloop. Catamarans have good stability, and 
        can go really fast, this type of sailboat has two hulls connected by beams in between covered by a trampoline 
        type floor. For advanced sailors, the Catamaran can be a thrilling ride. There are multiple kinds of sloops, 
        we have the standard sloop. A great choice for beginners to learn the ropes of sailing and to become more 
        comfortable on the water. This boat is also good for hanging out with a few friends and having a good time. 
        Then we have the racing sloop, this boat can be one of the fastest sailboats in southeast Idaho. 
        The single hull design helps the boat cut through the water with ease. This type of sailboat is 
        best used by those who have done sailing for a bit as the design cuts stability for that increase of speed.
